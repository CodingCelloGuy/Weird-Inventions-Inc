        Do the kids you know complain about how they need to bring their dolls everywhere?
        Do they say that the dolls are bored, or that they need exercise?
        The Automatic Doll Walker will solve these problems with a creative new approach.
        Instead of scolding the kid, take their doll, and place it on the walker, inside or outside.
        The walker will move the doll around the path you choose (up to 35 feet!), so the kid can't make their arguments.
        Get yours today and get rid of one more annoyance from your life!
